          <h2>Micky Dolenz</h2>
          <p>In 1965, Dolenz was cast in the television sitcom The Monkees and became the drummer and a lead vocalist in the band created for the show. He was not actually a drummer and needed lessons even to be able to mime credibly, but eventually
            was taught how to play properly. By the time The Monkees went on tour in late 1966, Dolenz was competent enough to play the drums himself.[5] He learned to play right-handed and left-footed because of a leg disease called Perthes making
            his right leg weak. Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart, writers of many of The Monkees' songs, observed quickly that when brought into the studio together, the four actors would try to make each other laugh. Because of this, the writers often
            brought in each singer individually. The antics escalated until one time Dolenz poured a cup of Coca-Cola on Don Kirshner's head; at the time, Dolenz did not know Kirshner on sight.</p>

          <h2>Davy Jones</h2>
          <p>From 1966 to 1971, Jones was a member of the Monkees, a pop-rock group formed expressly for a television show of the same name. With Screen Gems producing the series, Jones was shortlisted for auditions, as he was the only Monkee who was
            signed to a deal with the studio, but still had to meet producers Bob Rafelson's and Bert Schneider's standards.[14] Jones sang lead vocals on many of the Monkees' recordings, including "I Wanna Be Free" and "Daydream Believer".[14] The
            DVD release of the first season of the show contained commentary from the various bandmates. In Peter Tork's commentary, he stated that Jones was a good drummer and had the live performance lineups been based solely on playing ability, it
            should have been Tork on guitar, Mike Nesmith on bass, and Jones on drums, with Micky Dolenz taking the fronting role, rather than as it was done (with Nesmith on guitar, Tork on bass, and Dolenz on drums). Mostly playing tambourine or
            maracas, Jones filled in briefly for Tork on bass when he played keyboards.

          <h2>Michael Nesmith</h2>
          <p>From 1965 to early 1970, Nesmith was a member of the television pop-rock band the Monkees, created for the television situation comedy of the same name. Nesmith won his role largely by appearing nonchalant when he auditioned. He rode his
            motorcycle to the audition, and wore a wool hat to keep his hair out of his eyes; producers Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider remembered the "wool hat" guy, and called Nesmith back.
            Once he was cast, Screen Gems bought his songs so they could be used in the show. Many of the songs Nesmith wrote for the Monkees, such as "The Girl I Knew Somewhere", "Mary, Mary", and "Listen to the Band", became minor hits. One song he
            wrote, "You Just May Be the One", is in mixed meter, interspersing 5/4 bars into an otherwise 4/4 structure.

          <h2>Peter Tork</h2>
          <p>Tork was a proficient musician before he joined The Monkees, and though other members of the group were not allowed to play their own instruments on their first two albums, he had played what he described as "third chair guitar" on
            Michael Nesmith's song "Papa Gene's Blues" on their first album. He subsequently played keyboards, bass guitar, banjo, harpsichord, and other instruments on their recordings. He co-wrote, along with Joey Richards, the closing theme song
            of the second season of The Monkees, "For Pete's Sake". On the show, he was relegated to acting as the "lovable dummy", a persona Tork had developed as a folk singer in New York's Greenwich Village.[13]</p>
